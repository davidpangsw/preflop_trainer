# preflop_trainer

A Flutter project for Poker Preflop training

## Roadmap
- No feature creep: Only preflop training is enough. Only implement the game setting I am playing for now.

- Day 1:
    - Randomly draw and Visualize game state
    - Setting up Flashcards and Algorithm (SM2)
    - Import all OPEN answers
    - Host on vercel.app
